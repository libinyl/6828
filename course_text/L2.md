PC architecture
---------------

-   A full PC has:
    -   an x86 CPU with registers, execution unit, and memory management
    -   CPU chip pins include address and data signals
    -   memory
    -   disk
    -   keyboard
    -   display
    -   other resources: BIOS ROM, clock, \...
-   We will start with the original 16-bit 8086 CPU (1978)
-   CPU runs instructions:

        for(;;){
            run next instruction
        }

-   Needs work space: registers
    -   four 16-bit data registers: AX, BX, CX, DX
    -   each in two 8-bit halves, e.g. AH and AL
    -   very fast, very few
-   More work space: memory
    -   CPU sends out address on address lines (wires, one bit per wire)
    -   Data comes back on data lines
    -   *or* data is written to data lines
-   Add address registers: pointers into memory
    -   SP - stack pointer
    -   BP - frame base pointer
    -   SI - source index
    -   DI - destination index
-   Instructions are in memory too!
    -   IP - instruction pointer (PC on PDP-11, everything else)
    -   increment after running each instruction
    -   can be modified by CALL, RET, JMP, conditional jumps
-   Want conditional jumps
    -   FLAGS - various condition codes
        -   whether last arithmetic operation overflowed
        -   \... was positive/negative
        -   \... was \[not\] zero
        -   \... carry/borrow on add/subtract
        -   \... etc.
        -   whether interrupts are enabled
        -   direction of data copy instructions
    -   JP, JN, J\[N\]Z, J\[N\]C, J\[N\]O \...
-   Still not interesting - need I/O to interact with outside world
    -   Original PC architecture: use dedicated *I/O space*
        -   Works same as memory accesses but set I/O signal
        -   Only 1024 I/O addresses
        -   Accessed with special instructions (IN, OUT)
        -   Example: write a byte to line printer:

                #define DATA_PORT    0x378
                #define STATUS_PORT  0x379
                #define   BUSY 0x80
                #define CONTROL_PORT 0x37A
                #define   STROBE 0x01
                void
                lpt_putc(int c)
                {
                  /* wait for printer to consume previous byte */
                  while((inb(STATUS_PORT) & BUSY) == 0)
                    ;

                  /* put the byte on the parallel lines */
                  outb(DATA_PORT, c);

                  /* tell the printer to look at the data */
                  outb(CONTROL_PORT, STROBE);
                  outb(CONTROL_PORT, 0);
                }
                       

    -   Memory-Mapped I/O
        -   Use normal physical memory addresses
            -   Gets around limited size of I/O address space
            -   No need for special instructions
            -   System controller routes to appropriate device
        -   Works like \`\`magic\'\' memory:
            -   *Addressed* and *accessed* like memory, but \...
            -   \... does not *behave* like memory!
            -   Reads and writes can have \`\`side effects\'\'
            -   Read results can change due to external events
-   What if we want to use more than 2\^16 bytes of memory?
    -   8086 has 20-bit physical addresses, can have 1 Meg RAM
    -   the extra four bits usually come from a 16-bit \"segment
        register\":
    -   CS - code segment, for fetches via IP
    -   SS - stack segment, for load/store via SP and BP
    -   DS - data segment, for load/store via other registers
    -   ES - another data segment, destination for string operations
    -   virtual to physical translation: pa = va + seg\*16
    -   e.g. set CS = 4096 to execute starting at 65536
    -   tricky: can\'t use the 16-bit address of a stack variable as a
        pointer
    -   a *far pointer* includes full segment:offset (16 + 16 bits)
    -   tricky: pointer arithmetic and array indexing across segment
        boundaries
-   But 8086\'s 16-bit addresses and data were still painfully small
    -   80386 added support for 32-bit data and addresses (1985)
    -   boots in 16-bit mode, boot.S switches to 32-bit mode
    -   registers are 32 bits wide, called EAX rather than AX
    -   operands and addresses that were 16-bit became 32-bit in 32-bit
        mode, e.g. ADD does 32-bit arithmetic
    -   prefixes 0x66/0x67 toggle between 16-bit and 32-bit operands and
        addresses: in 32-bit mode, MOVW is expressed as 0x66 MOVW
    -   the .code32 in boot.S tells assembler to generate 0x66 for e.g.
        MOVW
    -   80386 also changed segments and added paged memory\...
-   Example instruction encoding

           b8 cd ab        16-bit CPU,  AX <- 0xabcd
            b8 34 12 cd ab      32-bit CPU, EAX <- 0xabcd1234
            66 b8 cd ab     32-bit CPU,  AX <- 0xabcd

x86 Physical Memory Map
-----------------------

-   The physical address space mostly looks like ordinary RAM
-   Except some low-memory addresses actually refer to other things
-   Writes to VGA memory appear on the screen
-   Reset or power-on jumps to ROM at 0xfffffff0 (so must be ROM at
    top\...)

x86 Instruction Set
-------------------

-   Intel syntax: `op dst, src` (Intel manuals!)
-   AT&T (gcc/gas) syntax: `op src, dst` (labs, xv6)
    -   uses b, w, l suffix on instructions to specify size of operands
-   Operands are registers, constant, memory via register, memory via
    constant
-   Examples:
      --------------------------- ------------------------------------ -----------------
      [AT&T syntax]{.underline}   [\"C\"-ish equivalent]{.underline}   
      movl %eax, %edx             edx = eax;                           *register mode*
      movl \$0x123, %edx          edx = 0x123;                         *immediate*
      movl 0x123, %edx            edx = \*(int32\_t\*)0x123;           *direct*
      movl (%ebx), %edx           edx = \*(int32\_t\*)ebx;             *indirect*
      movl 4(%ebx), %edx          edx = \*(int32\_t\*)(ebx+4);         *displaced*
      --------------------------- ------------------------------------ -----------------

-   Instruction classes
    -   data movement: MOV, PUSH, POP, \...
    -   arithmetic: TEST, SHL, ADD, AND, \...
    -   i/o: IN, OUT, \...
    -   control: JMP, JZ, JNZ, CALL, RET
    -   string: REP MOVSB, \...
    -   system: IRET, INT

gcc x86 calling conventions
---------------------------

-   x86 dictates that stack grows down:
      ----------------------------------- ------------------------------
      [Example instruction]{.underline}   [What it does]{.underline}

      pushl %eax                          subl \$4, %esp\
                                          movl %eax, (%esp)\

      popl %eax                           movl (%esp), %eax\
                                          addl \$4, %esp\

      call 0x12345                        pushl %eip ^(\*)^\
                                          movl \$0x12345, %eip ^(\*)^\

      ret                                 popl %eip ^(\*)^
      ----------------------------------- ------------------------------

    (\*) *Not real instructions*
-   GCC dictates how the stack is used. Contract between caller and
    callee on x86:
    -   at entry to a function (i.e. just after call):
        -   \%eip points at first instruction of function
        -   \%esp+4 points at first argument
        -   \%esp points at return address
    -   after ret instruction:
        -   \%eip contains return address
        -   \%esp points at arguments pushed by caller
        -   called function may have trashed arguments
        -   \%eax (and %edx, if return type is 64-bit) contains return
            value (or trash if function is `void`)
        -   \%eax, %edx (above), and %ecx may be trashed
        -   \%ebp, %ebx, %esi, %edi must contain contents from time of
            `call`
    -   Terminology:
        -   \%eax, %ecx, %edx are \"caller save\" registers
        -   \%ebp, %ebx, %esi, %edi are \"callee save\" registers
-   Functions can do anything that doesn\'t violate contract. By
    convention, GCC does more:
    -   each function has a stack frame marked by %ebp, %esp

                          +------------+   |
                           | arg 2      |   \
                           +------------+    >- previous function's stack frame
                           | arg 1      |   /
                           +------------+   |
                           | ret %eip   |   /
                           +============+   
                           | saved %ebp |   \
                    %ebp-> +------------+   |
                           |            |   |
                           |   local    |   \
                           | variables, |    >- current function's stack frame
                           |    etc.    |   /
                           |            |   |
                           |            |   |
                    %esp-> +------------+   /
                    

    -   \%esp can move to make stack frame bigger, smaller
    -   \%ebp points at saved %ebp from previous function, chain to walk
        stack
    -   function prologue:

                       pushl %ebp
                        movl %esp, %ebp
                    

        or

                       enter $0, $0
                    

        enter usually not used: 4 bytes vs 3 for pushl+movl, not on
        hardware fast-path anymore

    -   function epilogue can easily find return EIP on stack:

                       movl %ebp, %esp
                        popl %ebp
                    

        or

                       leave
                    

        leave used often because it\'s 1 byte, vs 3 for movl+popl

-   Big example:
    -   C code

                   int main(void) { return f(8)+1; }
                    int f(int x) { return g(x); }
                    int g(int x) { return x+3; }
                    

    -   assembler

                   _main:
                                prologue
                        pushl %ebp
                        movl %esp, %ebp
                                body
                        pushl $8
                        call _f
                        addl $1, %eax
                                epilogue
                        movl %ebp, %esp
                        popl %ebp
                        ret
                    _f:
                                prologue
                        pushl %ebp
                        movl %esp, %ebp
                                body
                        pushl 8(%esp)
                        call _g
                                epilogue
                        movl %ebp, %esp
                        popl %ebp
                        ret

                    _g:
                                prologue
                        pushl %ebp
                        movl %esp, %ebp
                                save %ebx
                        pushl %ebx
                                body
                        movl 8(%ebp), %ebx
                        addl $3, %ebx
                        movl %ebx, %eax
                                restore %ebx
                        popl %ebx
                                epilogue
                        movl %ebp, %esp
                        popl %ebp
                        ret
                    

-   Super-small `_g`:

               _g:
                    movl 4(%esp), %eax
                    addl $3, %eax
                    ret
            

-   Shortest `_f`?
-   Compiling, linking, loading:
    -   *Preprocessor* takes C source code (ASCII text), expands
        \#include etc, produces C source code
    -   *Compiler* takes C source code (ASCII text), produces assembly
        language (also ASCII text)
    -   *Assembler* takes assembly language (ASCII text), produces `.o`
        file (binary, machine-readable!)
    -   *Linker* takes multiple \'`.o`\'s, produces a single *program
        image* (binary)
    -   *Loader* loads the program image into memory at run-time and
        starts it executing

PC emulation
------------

-   The Bochs emulator works by
    -   doing exactly what a real PC would do,
    -   only implemented in software rather than hardware!
-   Runs as a normal process in a \"host\" operating system (e.g.,
    Linux)
-   Uses normal process storage to hold emulated hardware state: e.g.,
    -   Stores emulated CPU registers in global variables

                   int32_t regs[8];
                    #define REG_EAX 1;
                    #define REG_EBX 2;
                    #define REG_ECX 3;
                    ...
                    int32_t eip;
                    int16_t segregs[4];
                    ...
                    

    -   Stores emulated physical memory in Boch\'s memory

                            char mem[256*1024*1024];
                            

-   Execute instructions by simulating them in a loop:

           for (;;) {
                read_instruction();
                switch (decode_instruction_opcode()) {
                case OPCODE_ADD:
                    int src = decode_src_reg();
                    int dst = decode_dst_reg();
                    regs[dst] = regs[dst] + regs[src];
                    break;
                case OPCODE_SUB:
                    int src = decode_src_reg();
                    int dst = decode_dst_reg();
                    regs[dst] = regs[dst] - regs[src];
                    break;
                ...
                }
                eip += instruction_length;
            }
            

-   Simulate PC\'s physical memory map by decoding emulated \"physical\"
    addresses just like a PC would:

           #define KB      1024
            #define MB      1024*1024

            #define LOW_MEMORY  640*KB

-   Simulate I/O devices, etc., by detecting accesses to \"special\"
    memory and I/O space and emulating the correct behavior: e.g.,
    -   Reads/writes to emulated hard disk transformed into reads/writes
        of a file on the host system
    -   Writes to emulated VGA display hardware transformed into drawing
        into an X window
    -   Reads from emulated PC keyboard transformed into reads from X
        input event queue
